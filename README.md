# godot-playfab
is an [Azure PlayFab](https://playfab.com) addon for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). While it is very early, it is supposed to be two things:

1. A GDscript-native SDK to Azure PlayFab
2. A Godot Editor integration to administer your game


## Setup
### Enabling the addon
* Copy the folder `/addons/godot-playfab` in your own project's `/addons/` directory
* Enable the addon in your project settings

Only now you will see a new setting: `PLayfab --> Title ID`

### Setting the Title Id
* Got to [PlayFab](https://playfab.com), log in and copy your Title's ID
* In your Godot editor, open Project Settings
* Set the Title Id in `Playfab --> Title Id`
